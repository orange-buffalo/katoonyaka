                <h4>The Story</h4>
                <h2>It's time to add the direction</h2>

                <p>Knitting has been a major hobby of mine since childhood, but it has still remained just a hobby - in
                    spite of such a constancy, I have never seriously considered the possibility of turning my interest
                    into a business. But it is turned out that not finding a satisfaction in other fields of work, I
                    went back to my childhood fancies - that have always been a truly inspiration to me. Whether there
                    were dolls clothes or experiments with my own looks and moods, every time the creative process
                    swallowed me completely, making forget about time during turning my imagination into reality. Now it
                    is time not only to put all this into shape, but also add the direction.</p>

                <p>I value coziness, comfort, natural yarn and mostly gravitate towards warm autumn colors, however,
                    this does not keep me from experiments with cold tones.</p>

                <p>I hardly ever use the ready made knitting schemes and patterns. Basically, I just put my ideas into
                    action: thoroughly calculate the stitches and rows, modify some details and see what happens then. I
                    do my best to keep the quality of my work high and I am proud of it. But even more I am proud of
                    sharing with you the results of my efforts :)</p>
